1.  **Spark Execution Plans (`explain_plan_*.txt`)**
    *   `explain_plan_features.txt`: The formatted physical and logical plan generated by Spark's Catalyst optimizer for the feature engineering stage (joining prices and on-chain data).
    *   `explain_plan_predictions.txt`: The formatted plan for the final modeling stage, showing the pipeline transformations applied to the test data to generate predictions.
    *   These files are automatically generated by the `run_all.sh` script and serve as proof of Spark's query optimization.
